# Threat Intelligence Analyzer 🕵️‍♀️🔥

A sleek, Python-powered cybersecurity tool to analyze incoming threat feeds and detect blacklisted indicators of compromise (IOCs) in real time. Created by Lily for pros who like their code clean and their enemies panicked.

## 💡 What It Does

* Pulls threat intel from an external feed (replace with real API endpoint)
* Analyzes incoming data for blacklisted IPs
* Outputs alerts with timestamps and threat type info

## 🛡️ Features

* Clean main.py with zero fluff
* Extensible blacklist handling
* Instant threat detection output
* Ready for integration with SIEM or dashboard tools

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-lilypat/threat-intel-analyzer.git
cd threat-intel-analyzer
python main.py
```

## 🧠 Use Cases

* Real-time network monitoring
* SOC threat enrichment
* Learning platform for Python-based threat automation

## 🔧 Customize

Update `BLACKLISTED_IPS` to suit your network, or plug in external IP reputation sources. Replace the `THREAT_FEED_URL` with a real threat feed like AlienVault, AbuseIPDB, or your own private feed.
